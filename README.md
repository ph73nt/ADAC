# ADAC for Imagej
ADAC image import and export for ImageJ

To get going straight away, download the ADAC_Utils.jar binary file and place in your Imagej plugins directory for the following Imagej menu items:
* Plugins
  * ADAC
    * Export ADAC Image
    * Import ADAC Image

Most folks will be using the importer. Currently work very well for static all image types I have tried: planar, dynamic, SPECT and gated.

The export works well for planars, but development has stalled on the export function due to lack of requirement since most ADAC systems support either or both Interfile or DICOM.
