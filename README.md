# ADAC for Imagej
ADAC image import for ImageJ

To get going straight away, download the ADAC_Utils.jar binary file and place in your Imagej plugins directory for the following Imagej menu item:
* Plugins
    * ADAC
      * Import ADAC Image

The importer works well for  all image types I have tried: planar, dynamic, SPECT and gated. Gated tomographic sets open as hyperstacks.
